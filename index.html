        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Jateen Solanki, a strategic finance professional with over 15 years of experience driving
            financial planning, analysis, and enterprise-wide initiatives. I specialize in partnering with CFOs to
            execute strategic priorities like cost optimization, working capital management, and digital finance
            transformation. My passion lies in translating complex financial data into actionable narratives that
            empower stakeholders to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, as an Associate/Process Manager at <strong>J.P. Morgan India Services</strong>, I lead enterprise
            migration programs, recently transitioning ₹200 Crore of assets under administration. I manage a dynamic
            team and have successfully implemented automated reconciliation frameworks that improved data accuracy to
            99.9%. Leveraging tools like <strong>Power Query</strong> and <strong>Alteryx</strong>, I drive cost
            optimization and have developed executive dashboards to provide real-time visibility on fund performance and
            operational efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to this, I served as an FP&A Analyst at <strong>Archer Transnational Systems</strong>, where I
            partnered with leadership to design enterprise KPI frameworks and implement <strong>Power BI</strong>
            dashboards for real-time decision-making. I played a key role in the <strong>NetSuite ERP</strong>
            implementation across US and India offices, enhancing data granularity. My work involved developing annual
            capital forecasts, dynamic pricing models, and cashflow projections to optimize working capital and improve
            deal margins.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my earlier tenure at <strong>J.P. Morgan</strong>, I grew from a Team Leader to a Manager in Fund
            Accounting Onboarding. I managed the end-to-end migration of mutual funds across US, UK, and ANZ regions,
            generating NAVs and ensuring precise reconciliation of fund accounting and custody incomes. I took pride in
            building high-performance teams, implementing dynamic work allocation, and delivering accurate MIS reports
            to facilitate client trading and investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            At <strong>Willis Tower Watson</strong>, I worked as a Senior Data Associate, where I focused on analyzing
            <strong>NPS data</strong> to shape marketing and retention strategies. I designed executive-level
            presentations that influenced strategic decisions, successfully improving client retention rates by 10%. My
            role involved deep-diving into client feedback and financial viability to recommend impactful solutions to
            senior management.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey began at <strong>CRISIL Ltd (S&P Cap IQ)</strong>, where I gathered and analyzed information on
            securitized assets. I performed cross-product performance analysis and ensured data accuracy in reporting
            models. I was instrumental in building analytical teams, training members on process improvements, and
            implementing automation initiatives to drive efficiency.
